START UP SERVER AND STORE A NEW USER IN MONGO LOCALLY

***Replace ariel with your directory throughout

NAVIGATE TOO ---> $cd '/home/ariel/435-master'

ALRIGHT NOW START MONGO SERVER ---> $mongod --dbpath '/home/ariel/435-master/data'

Once the server is up and running pointed to data we can now add things and grab things from our mongo database.

Open a new terminal

NAVIGATE TOO ---> $cd '/home/ariel/435-master'

START SERVER ---> $node ./server.js

This should create a new user under what we have entered in the NewUser variable located in the mainDB.js file

var testUser = new User({
	username: 'testUser',
	password: 'testPassword'
});

The next step is setting up 'testUser' and 'testPassword' to where it grabs these values from the textboxes in our web application.

To see if the user was saved in the mongodb simply follow these steps:

1)Open a new terminal 
2)NAVIGATE TOO ---> $cd '/home/ariel/435-master'
3)TYPE IN TERMINAL ---> $mongo
4)now a new mongo connection should be up and you should be in the mongo shell
5) type the following commands in the mongo shell
	>show dbs (you should see chatappdb)
	>use chatappdb
	>show collections ( you should see users)
.	>db.users.find().pretty()   (this should display the new use entered)
	>exit (to exit mongo shell)
